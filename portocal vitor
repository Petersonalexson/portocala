Let's break down the revised process using the unique combination of Cost Center and Description 2:

Aggregation by Unique Cost Center and Description 2

In your specific sheet, you aggregate the amounts by combining the Cost Center (from your raw data) and the corresponding Description 2 (which comes from your account mapping). This unique combination defines each row that will eventually appear in your forecast.
Period Mapping

Source Period: In the specific sheet, the period is found in cell A1.
Transformation: This period value is transformed via your reference mapping, where it appears in cell F2.
Forecast Alignment: The transformed period (now in F2) aligns with the forecast sheet's period header found in cell C2. This ensures that the aggregated amounts are populated under the correct period column in the forecast.
Forecast Sheet Layout

Cost Center Sections:
The forecast sheet designates sections for each cost center. For example, you have cost centers starting at cells C6, C22, C38, C54, C70.
Description 2 Rows:
Under each cost center section, you list the unique Description 2 values (as determined by your mapping). These rows are where the aggregated amounts will be placed.
Period Columns:
To the right of the Description 2 rows, you have columns that correspond to different periods. The header for these columns starts at cell C2.
Note on Headers:
There are no additional headers immediately to the right of the cost center cells (like C6, C22, etc.). Instead, the period headers are only present above the columns where the forecast amounts are populated.
Data Flow Summary

Step 1: From the specific sheet, aggregate amounts by the unique combination of Cost Center and Description 2.
Step 2: Take the period from cell A1, transform it via the reference mapping (to cell F2), which corresponds to the period header in the forecast sheet (C2).
Step 3: In the forecast sheet, under each cost center section, list the mapped Description 2 rows.
Step 4: Populate the aggregated amounts in the correct period column (aligned by the period header from C2) for each unique Cost Center/Description 2 pair.
This structure ensures that your forecast sheet accurately reflects the data by aligning the period, cost center, and description mapping so that every unique combination is represented with the correct forecast amount under the appropriate period column.
